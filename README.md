## An ASP.NET Core SignalR Chat with a React TypeScript client
I've chosen to implement idea number 2, "*A chat where everyone can talk to each other, something like Slack.*" by using templets for:
* **dotnet webapi** for the server-side API
* **create-react-app --template typescript** for the client, a graphical user interface

To enable real-time communication I'll install @microsoft/signalr on the client.

## Project planning
### A picture of my initial plan, a Kanban board here in my GitHub repo as a project.
NOTE:
* I could not fit all the cards in one To do column so I divided the cards by server and client. 
* I hope this picture is initial enough although I've already crossed tasks off and moved some cards.
